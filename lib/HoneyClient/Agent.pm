=head1 LOCAL FUNCTIONS

The following init() and destroy() functions are the only direct
calls required to startup and shutdown the SOAP server.

All other interactions with this daemon should be performed as
C<SOAP::Lite> function calls, in order to ensure consistency across
client sessions.  See the L<"EXTERNAL SOAP FUNCTIONS"> section, for
more details.

=head2 HoneyClient::Agent->init(address => $localAddr, port => $localPort, ...)

=over 4

Starts a new SOAP server, within a child process.

I<Inputs>:
 B<$localAddr> is an optional argument, specifying the IP address for the SOAP server to listen on.
 B<$localPort> is an optional argument, specifying the TCP port for the SOAP server to listen on.

Additionally optional, driver-specific arguments can be specified 
as sub-hashtables, where the top-level key corresponds to the name of 
the implemented driver and the value contains all the expected hash data
that can be fed to HoneyClient::Agent::Driver->new() instances.

 Here is an example set of arguments:

   HoneyClient::Agent->init(
       address => '127.0.0.1',
       port    => 9000,
       IE      => {

               'http://www.mitre.org/' => 1,
           },

# Helper function designed to acquire exclusive access to the
# shared $driverData, for use within any thread.
#
# In perl, it is difficult to share hashtables between threads.
# However, it is easy to share scalars between threads.
# As such, we share a hashtable between threads by *serializing*
# the data using nfreeze().  The result can be stored in a scalar.
# 
# When we are in a thread where we subsequently want to read/use
# this hashtable, we thaw() the serialized data (it performs the
# deserialization process) and use the hashtable accordingly.
#
# This function guarantees that no other thread will access
# $driverData and returns the thaw()'d contents of $driverData.
#
# Input: None
# Output: driverData (deserialized)
sub _lock {
    # Acquire lock on stored driver state.

# Helper function designed to release exclusive access to the
# shared $driverData, for use within any thread.
#
# By calling this function, we assume that the thread has already
# called _lock() and would like to (optionally) update $driverData
# with a new, modified hashtable, prior to releasing the lock
# on $driverData.
#
# This function can optionally take in a normal hashtable reference,
# overwriting the $driverData with the contents of the supplied
# hashtable.  Once the $driverData's updated contents has been
# set and serialized, this function releases the corresponding
# lock.
#
# Input: driverData (deserialized, optional)

# Driver object; checks to see if there's a new entry within the
# driver's corresponding update queue; and dequeues the *all*
# entries in the queue, overwriting the Driver's state data
# accordingly.
#
# The external updateState() call adds new driver state into the queue,
# one entry per call.  The internal _update() function merges this
# driver state with the currently running driver, merging everything
# queued per call.  In order words, a single call to _update()
# *WILL* empty the corresponding Driver update queue completely
# -- all entries within the queue will be dequeued per _update()
# call made.

=head2 run(driver_name => $driverName)

=over 4

Runs the Agent for one cycle.  In this cycle, the following happens:

=over 4

=item 1)

The specified Driver is driven for multiple work units, where each
consecutive drive operation contacts the same network resources
(aka. "targets").  The Driver ceases its operation, as soon as
it has exhausted all targets or until it is ready to contact a
different set of targets.

=item 2)

Once the specified driver has stopped, the Agent performs a corresponding
Integrity check.

=back 

# XXX: Fill this in.

I<Inputs>: 
 B<$driverName> is the name of the Driver to use, when running this 
cycle.
 
I<Output>: Returns true if the Agent successfully started a new cycle;
returns false, if the Agent is still running an existing cycle and
has not finished yet.

I<Notes>:
During a single run() cycle, it is expected that the driven application
will only contact the same targets.  This allows the Manager to update
firewall rules between cycles.
