=head1 NAME

HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem - Perl extension to perform static
checks of the Windows OS filesystem.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem version 0.97.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem;
  use Data::Dumper;

  # Create the filesystem object.  Upon creation, the object will
  # be initialized, by performing a baseline of the filesystem.
  my $filesystem = HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem->new();

  # ... Some time elapses ...

  # Check the filesystem, for any violations.
  my $changes = $filesystem->check();

  if (!defined($changes)) {
      print "No filesystem changes have occurred.\n";
  } else {
      print "Filesystem has changed:\n";
      print Dumper($changes);
  }

  # $changes refers to an array of hashtable references, where
  # each hashtable has the following format:
  #
  # $changes = [ {
  #     # Indicates if the filesystem entry was deleted,
  #     # added, or changed.
  #     'status' => $STATUS_DELETED | $STATUS_ADDED | $STATUS_MODIFIED,
  #     'name'  => 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32...',
  #     'mtime' => 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', # new mtime for added/modified files;
  #                                       # old mtime for deleted files
  #
  #     # content will only exist for added/modified files
  #     'content' => {
  #         'size' => 1263,                                       # size of new content 
  #         'type' => 'application/octect-stream',                # type of new content
  #         'md5'  => 'b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184',         # md5  of new content
  #         'sha1' => 'f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f', # sha1 of new content
  #     },
  # }, ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library allows the Integrity module to easily baseline and check
the Windows OS filesystem for any changes that may occur, while
instrumenting a target application.

=head1 METHODS IMPLEMENTED

The following functions have been implemented by any Filesystem object.

=head2 HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem->new($param => $value, ...)

=over 4

Creates a new Filesystem object, which contains a hashtable
containing any of the supplied "param => value" arguments.  Upon
creation, the Filesystem object performs a baseline of the Windows
filesystem.

I<Inputs>:
 B<$param> is an optional parameter variable.
 B<$value> is $param's corresponding value.

Note: If any $param(s) are supplied, then an equal number of
corresponding $value(s) B<must> also be specified.

I<Output>: The instantiated Filesystem B<$object>, fully initialized.

=back

=begin testing

diag("These tests will create temporary files in /tmp.  Be sure to cleanup this directory, if any of these tests fail.");

# Create a generic Filesystem object, with test state data.
my $filesystem = HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem->new(test => 1, bypass_baseline => 1);
is($filesystem->{test}, 1, "new(test => 1, bypass_baseline => 1)") or diag("The new() call failed.");
isa_ok($filesystem, 'HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem', "new(test => 1, bypass_baseline => 1)") or diag("The new() call failed.");

diag("Performing baseline check of the filesystem; this may take some time...");

# Perform baseline.
$filesystem = HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem->new();
isa_ok($filesystem, 'HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity::Filesystem', "new()") or diag("The new() call failed.");

    # - For each parameter given, it overwrites any corresponding
    #   parameters specified within the default hashtable, %PARAMS,
    #   with custom entries that were given as parameters.

    #   merged hashtable, as an 'object'.

    return $self;

=head2 $object->check(no_prepare => $no_prepare)

=over 4

Checks the filesystem for various changes, based upon
the filesystem baseline, when the new() method was invoked.

I<Inputs>:
 B<$no_prepare> is an optional parameter, specifying the output
format of the changes found.

I<Output>:
 B<$changes>, which is an array of hashtable references, where each
hashtable has the following format:

  If $no_prepare == 1, then the format will be:

  $changes = [ {
      # Indicates if the filesystem entry was deleted,
      # added, or changed.
      'status' => $STATUS_DELETED | $STATUS_ADDED | $STATUS_MODIFIED,

      # If the entry has been added/changed, then this 
      # hashtable contains the file/directory's new information.
      'new' => {
          'name'  => 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32...',
          'size'  => 1263, # in bytes
          'mtime' => 1178135092, # modification time, seconds since epoch
      },

      # If the entry has been deleted/changed, then this
      # hashtable contains the file/directory's old information.
      'old' => {
          'name'  => 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32...',
          'size'  => 802, # in bytes
          'mtime' => 1178135028, # modification time, seconds since epoch
      },
  }, ]

  Otherwise, the format will be:

  $changes = [ {
      # Indicates if the filesystem entry was deleted,
      # added, or changed.
      'status' => $STATUS_DELETED | $STATUS_ADDED | $STATUS_MODIFIED,
      'name'  => 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32...',
      'mtime' => 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS', # new mtime for added/modified files;
                                        # old mtime for deleted files

      # content will only exist for added/modified files
      'content' => {
          'size' => 1263,                                       # size of new content 
          'type' => 'application/octet-stream',                 # type of new content
          'md5'  => 'b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184',         # md5  of new content
          'sha1' => 'f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f', # sha1 of new content
      },
  }, ]

I<Notes>:
 If $no_prepare != 1 or $no_prepare == undef, then the outputted changes will B<NEVER> refer to
any directories.  All the changes will correspond to individual files.

=head1 BUGS & ASSUMPTIONS

This library performs B<STATIC> checks of the Windows filesystem.
If malware modifies the filesystem between the time the $object->new()
and $object->check() methods are called, then this library may B<FAIL>
to detect those changes if:

=over 4

=item *

Malware writes itself to one of the regions of the filesystem that is
excluded.  See the <HoneyClient/><Agent/><Integrity/><exclude_list/>
element, in the etc/honeyclient.xml file.

=item *

Malware writes itself to a monitored region of the filesystem but
reverses all its activity (including self-deletion).

=back

This library also only monitors B<FILE> changes.  Thus, if malware
manipulates B<EMPTY DIRECTORIES> or B<SYMLINKS> on the system, then
this library will B<NOT> report those changes.
