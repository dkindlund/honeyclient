=head1 NAME

HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity - Perl extension to perform configurable 
integrity checks of the Agent VM OS.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity version 0.99.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity;
  use Data::Dumper;

  # Create the Integrity object.  Upon creation, the object will
  # be initialized, by performing a baseline of the Agent VM OS.
  my $integrity = HoneyClient::Agent::Integrity->new();

  # ... Some time elapses ...

  # Check the Agent VM, for any violations.
  my $changes = $integrity->check();

  if (!defined($changes)) {
      print "No integrity violations have occurred.\n";
  } else {
      print "System integrity has been compromised:\n";
      print Dumper($changes);
  }

  # $changes refers to an array of hashtable references, where
  # each hashtable has the following format:
  #
  # $changes = {
  #     registry => [ {
  #         # The registry directory name.
  #         'key' => 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software...',
  #
  #         # Indicates if the registry directory was deleted,
  #         # added, or changed.
  #         'status' => 'deleted' | 'added' | 'changed',
  # 
  #         # An array containing the list of entries within the
  #         # registry directory that have been deleted, added, or
  #         # changed.  If this array is empty, then the corresponding

  #         # no entries.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

# TODO: This text needs to change.

=head2 INITIALIZATION

# TODO: This text needs to change.

In order to properly check the system, a snapshot must be taken of a known-good
state.

For the filesystem this means a listing is created which contains 
cryptographic hashes of files in their start state. The only files what are 
checked are those which are explicitly specified in the checklist file (or are 
found in a specified directory) and are not in the exclusion list will be checked.
Initialization of the filesystem is done with the initFileSystem() function, 
described later.

For the registry a similar logic applies in that the only the specified keys are
checked and only if they are not in the exclusion list. The desired registry keys
are exported to a text file via the command line functionality of regedit. This
is done via initRegistry().


=head2 CHECKING

# TODO: This text needs to change.

Checking the filesystem entails running mostly the same code as the initialization
piece in order to obtain a snapshot of the current state of the filesystem. At that 
point additional checks are performed to look for additions, deletions, and 
modifications to the filesystem. These checks are done with checkFileSystem().

A speed-optimized check of the registry is performed by first dumping the current
state, again with the command line version of regedit. Then the unix "diff"
utility is used to compare the clean registry dump to the current one. The output
from a diff is in a format which shows the minimum possible changes which can be
done to the first file in order to yield the same content as the second file. 
Therefore this format must be parsed in order to determine what specific additions,
deletions, and modifications were made to the clean registry. Further, because 
the output of diff need not exactly reflect changes (for instance when the same
content would be the first line of the previous value and the last line of the new 
value) this requires some cases to re-consult the original and current state in order 
to disambiguate the changes which were made. These tests are done in checkRegistry().

NOTE: Because these are simple, static, user-space checks, they can fail in the 
presense of even user-space rootkits. Therefore these checks should not be taken as 
definitive proof of the absense of malicious software until they are integrated more
tightly with the system.

The following functions have been implemented by any Integrity object.

=over 4

Creates a new Integrity object, which contains a hashtable
containing any of the supplied "param => value" arguments.  Upon
creation, the Integrity object initializes all of its sub-modules,
by creating a baseline of the operating system.

I<Inputs>:
 B<$param> is an optional parameter variable.
 B<$value> is $param's corresponding value.
 
Note: If any $param(s) are supplied, then an equal number of
corresponding $value(s) B<must> also be specified.

I<Output>: The instantiated Integrity B<$object>, fully initialized.
