# Description: An module used for extracting URLs from Adobe
#              Flash (SWF) movies.  If the URLs could not be
#              extracted, but the movie appears "interesting,"
#              then it is flagged for analyst review.

Adds the specified URL to the hash of URLs to be returned.  Checks
to see if the URL is relative or absolute, and in the former case
appends the base URL appropriately.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::ActiveContent::Flash->extract()

=over 4

Extracts URLs from an Adobe Flash SWF movie file.  Takes in a file
name and a base URL, and uses the latter to construct relative URLs
to local links found in the movie.  Returns a hash containing the
found URLs as keys, and values of 1 for each of them, where the
values represent the weights used by the link ranking code.
