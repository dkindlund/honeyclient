=head1 NAME

HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser - Perl extension to drive a
web browser, running inside a HoneyClient VM.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser version 1.00.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser;

  # Library used exclusively for debugging complex objects.
  use Data::Dumper;

  # Create a new Browser object, initialized with a collection
  # of URLs to visit.
  my $browser = HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser->new(
      links_to_visit => {
          'http://www.google.com'  => 1,
          'http://www.cnn.com'     => 1,
      },
  );

  # If you want to see what type of "state information" is physically
  # inside $browser, try this command at any time.
  print Dumper($browser);

  # Continue to "drive" the driver, until it is finished.
  while (!$browser->isFinished()) {

      # Before we drive the application to a new set of resources,
      # find out where we will be going within the application, first.
      print "About to contact the following resources:\n";
      print Dumper($browser->next());

      # Now, drive browser for one iteration.
      $browser->drive();

      # Get the driver's progress.
      print "Status:\n";
      print Dumper($browser->status());

  }

  # At this stage, the driver has exhausted its collection of links
  # to visit.  Let's say we want to add the URL "http://www.mitre.org"
  # to the driver's list.
  $browser->{links_to_visit}->{'http://www.mitre.org'} = 1;

  # Now, drive the browser for one iteration.
  $browser->drive();

  # Or, we can specify the URL as an argument.
  $browser->drive(url => "http://www.mitre.org");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library allows the Agent module to drive an instance of any browser,
running inside the HoneyClient VM.  The purpose of this module is to
programmatically navigate the browser to different websites, in order to
become purposefully infected with new malware.

This module is object-oriented in design, retaining all state information
within itself for easy access.  A specific browser implementation, such as
'IE' or 'FF', must inherit from this package.

Fundamentally, the Browser driver is initialized with a set of absolute URLs
for the browser to drive to.  Upon visiting each URL, the driver collects
any B<new> links found and will attempt to drive the browser to each
valid URL upon subsequent iterations of work.

For each top-level URL given, the driver will attempt to process all
corresponding links that are hosted on the same server, in order to
simulate a complete 'spider' of each server.  

URLs are added and removed from hashtables, as keys.  For each URL, a
calculated "priority" (a positive integer) of the URL is assigned the
value.  When the Browser is ready to go to a new link, it will always go
to the next link that has the highest priority.  If two URLs have the same
priority, then the Browser will chose among those two at random.

Furthermore, the Browser driver will try to visit all links shared by a
common server in order before moving on to drive to other,
external links in an ordered fashion.  B<However>, the Browser may end
up re-visiting old sites, if new links were found that the
Browser has not visited yet. 

As the Browser driver navigates the browser to each link, it
maintains a set of hashtables that record when valid links were
visited (see L<links_visited>); when invalid links were found
(see L<links_ignored>); and when the browser attempted to visit
a link but the operation timed out (see L<links_timed_out>).
By maintaining this internal history, the driver will B<never>
navigate the browser to the same link twice.

Lastly, it is highly recommended that for each driver B<$object>,
one should call $object->isFinished() prior to making a subsequent
call to $object->drive(), in order to verify that the driver has
not exhausted its set of links to visit.  Otherwise, if
$object->drive() is called with an empty set of links to visit,
the corresponding operation will B<croak>.

=head1 DEFAULT PARAMETER LIST

When a Browser B<$object> is instantiated using the B<new()> function,
the following parameters are supplied default values.  Each value
can be overridden by specifying the new (key => value) pair into the
B<new()> function, as arguments.

Furthermore, as each parameter is initialized, each can be individually
retrieved and set at any time, using the following syntax:

  my $value = $object->{key}; # Gets key's value.
  $object->{key} = $value;    # Sets key's value.

=head2 links_to_visit

=over 4

This parameter is a hashtable of fully qualified URLs for the browser
to visit.  Specifically, each 'key' corresponds to an absolute URL
and the 'value' is always 1.

=back

=head2 links_visited

=over 4

This parameter is a hashtable of fully qualified URLs that the
browser has already visited.  Specifically, each 'key' corresponds
to an absolute URL and the 'value' is a string representing the
date and time of when the link was visited.

B<Note>: See internal documentation of _getTimestamp() for the
corresponding date/time format of each value.

=back

=head2 links_ignored

=over 4

This parameter is a hashtable of fully qualified URLs that the browser
has found during its link traversal process, but the browser could not
access the link.

Links could be added to this list if access requires any type of
authentication, or if the link points to a non-HTTP or HTTPS
resource (i.e., "javascript:doNetDetect()").

Specifically, each 'key' corresponds to an absolute URL and the
'value' is a string representing the date and time of when the link
was visited.

B<Note>: See internal documentation of _getTimestamp() for the
corresponding date/time format of each value.

=back

=head2 relative_links_to_visit

=over 4

This parameter is a hashtable of fully qualified URLs, such that each
URL shares a common B<hostname>.  This is an internal hashtable used
by the Browser driver that should be initially empty.  As the Browser
driver extracts and removes new URLs off the B<links_to_visit> hashtable,
driving the browser to each URL, any B<relative> links found are
added into this hashtable; any B<external> links found are added
back into the B<links_to_visit> hashtable.

When driving to the next link, this hashtable is exhausted prior
to the main B<links_to_visit> hashtable.  This allows a
browser to navigate to all links hosted on the same server, prior
to contacting a different server.

Specifically, each 'key' corresponds to an absolute URL and the
'value' is always 1.

=back

=head2 next_link_to_visit

=over 4

This parameter is a scalar that contains the next URL to visit.
It is updated dynamically, any time $object->getNextLink() is called.

When the browser is ready to drive to the next link, B<next_link_to_visit>
is checked first.  If that value is B<undef>, then the B<relative_links_to_visit>
hashtable is checked next.  If that hashtable is empty, then finally the
B<links_to_visit> hashtable is checked last.

=back

=head2 links_timed_out

=over 4

This parameter is a hashtable of fully qualified URLs that the browser
has found during its link traversal process, but the browser
could not access the corresponding resource due to the operation
timing out.

Specifically, each 'key' corresponds to an absolute URL and the
'value' is a string representing the date and time of when access to
the resource was attempted.

B<Note>: See internal documentation of _getTimestamp() for the
corresponding date/time format of each value.

=back

=head2 ignore_timed_out_links

=over 4

If this parameter is set to 1, then the browser will also
never attempt to revisit any links that caused the browser to
time out.

=back

# XXX: Delete this, eventually.
#=head2 process_name
#
#=over 4
#
#A string containing the process name of the  browser application,
#as it appears in the Task Manager.
#
#=back

=head2 max_relative_links_to_visit

=over 4

An integer, representing the maximum number of relative links that
the browser should visit, before moving onto another website.  If
negative, then the browser will exhaust all possible relative links
found, before moving on.  This functionality is best effort; it's
possible for the browser to visit new links on previously visited
websites.

=back

=head2 positive_words

=over 4

An array of positive words, where a link's probability of being
visited (its score) will increase, if the link contains any of these
words.

=back

=head2 negative_words

=over 4

An array of negative words, where a link's probability of being
visited (its score) will decrease, if the link contains any of these
words.

=back

=head2 parse_active_content

=over 4

If set to 1, then the code will attempt to parse and extract links
within active content (e.g., Flash animations).  Otherwise, the
code will ignore all active content. 

=back

=head1 METHODS IMPLEMENTED

The following functions have been implemented by the Browser driver.  Many
of these methods were implementations of the parent Driver interface.

=head2 $object->drive(url => $url)

=over 4

Drives an instance of the browser for one iteration,
navigating to the next URL and updating the driver's corresponding
internal hashtables accordingly.

For a description of which hashtable is consulted upon each
iteration of drive(), see the L<next_link_to_visit> documentation, in
the "DEFAULT PARAMETER LIST" section.

Once a drive() iteration has completed, the corresponding browser process
is terminated.  Thus, each call to drive() invokes a new instance of the
browser.

 B<$url> is an optional argument, specifying the next immediate URL the browser must drive to.

I<Output>: The updated Browser driver B<$object>, containing state information
from driving the browser for one iteration.

B<Warning>: This method will B<croak> if the Browser driver object is B<unable>
to navigate to a new link, because its list of links to visit is empty and
no new URL was supplied.

=head2 _scoreLinks()

The _scoreLinks helper function takes a scalar which is the base url for
the web page, a scalar which holds the content of the page (HTML), and a
hash which contain the good and bad words.

This function will calculate the "popularity" scores of the links.
The function returns a hash which is keyed on the _absolute_ url
and contains the value of the score.

I<Output>: The populated %scored_links hash if the page is not empty. An empty
hash otherwise.

For example, if your raw HTML content is $content, and the base url is
$base you would use the following call to this function.

=head1 BUGS & ASSUMPTIONS

In a nutshell, this object is nothing more than a blessed anonymous
reference to a hashtable, where (key => value) pairs are defined in
the L<DEFAULT PARAMETER LIST>, as well as fed via the new() function
during object initialization.  As such, this package does B<not>
perform any rigorous B<data validation> prior to accepting any new
or overriding (key => value) pairs.

However, additional links can be fed to any Browser driver at any time, by
simply adding new hashtable entries to the B<links_to_visit> hashtable
within the B<$object>.

For example, if you wanted to add the URL "http://www.mitre.org"
to the Browser driver B<$object>, simply use the following code:

  $object->{links_to_visit}->{'http://www.mitre.org'} = 1;

In general, the Browser driver does B<not> know how many links it will
ultimately end up browsing to, until it conducts an exhaustive
spider of all initial URLs supplied.  As such, expect the output
of $object->status() to change significantly, upon each
$object->drive() iteration.

For example, if at one given point, the status of B<percent_complete>
is 30% and then this value drops to 15% upon another iteration, then
this means that the total number of links to drive to has greatly
increased.

Lastly, we assume the driven browser has been preconfigured to
B<not cache any data>.  This ensures the browser will render the most
recent version of the content hosted at each URL.
