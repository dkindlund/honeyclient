=head1 NAME

HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser::FF - Perl extension to drive Mozilla 
Firefox to a given web page.  This package extends the
HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser package, by overridding the drive() method.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser::FF version 1.01.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser::FF;

  # Library used exclusively for debugging complex objects.
  use Data::Dumper;

  # Create a new FF object, initialized with a collection
  # of URLs to visit.
  my $browser = HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser::FF->new(
      links_to_visit => {
          'http://www.google.com'  => 1,
          'http://www.cnn.com'     => 1,
      },
  );

  # If you want to see what type of "state information" is physically
  # inside $browser, try this command at any time.
  print Dumper($browser);

  # Continue to "drive" the driver, until it is finished.
  while (!$browser->isFinished()) {

      # Before we drive the application to a new set of resources,
      # find out where we will be going within the application, first.
      print "About to contact the following resources:\n";
      print Dumper($browser->next());

      # Now, drive browser for one iteration.
      $browser->drive();

      # Get the driver's progress.
      print "Status:\n";
      print Dumper($browser->status());

  }

  # At this stage, the driver has exhausted its collection of links
  # to visit.  Let's say we want to add the URL "http://www.mitre.org"
  # to the driver's list.
  $browser->{links_to_visit}->{'http://www.mitre.org'} = 1;

  # Now, drive the browser for one iteration.
  $browser->drive();
  
  # Or, we can specify the URL as an argument.
  $browser->drive(url => "http://www.mitre.org");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library allows the Agent module to drive an instance of Mozilla
Firefox inside the HoneyClient VM.  The purpose of this module is to
programmatically navigate this browser to different websites, in order to
become purposefully infected with new malware.

This module is object-oriented in design, retaining all state information
within itself for easy access.  This specific browser implementation inherits
all code from the HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser package.

Fundamentally, the FF driver is initialized with a set of absolute URLs
for the browser to drive to.  Upon visiting each URL, the driver collects
any B<new> links found and will attempt to drive the browser to each
valid URL upon subsequent iterations of work.

For each top-level URL given, the driver will attempt to process all
corresponding links that are hosted on the same server, in order to
simulate a complete 'spider' of each server.  

URLs are added and removed from hashtables, as keys.  For each URL, a
calculated "priority" (a positive integer) of the URL is assigned the
value.  When the FF driver is ready to go to a new link, it will always go
to the next link that has the highest priority.  If two URLs have the same
priority, then the FF driver will chose among those two at random.

Furthermore, the FF driver will try to visit all links shared by a
common server in order before moving on to drive to other,
external links in an ordered fashion.  B<However>, the FF driver may end
up re-visiting old sites, if new links were found that the
FF driver has not visited yet. 

As the FF driver navigates the browser to each link, it
maintains a set of hashtables that record when valid links were
visited (see L<links_visited>); when invalid links were found
(see L<links_ignored>); and when the browser attempted to visit
a link but the operation timed out (see L<links_timed_out>).
By maintaining this internal history, the driver will B<never>
navigate the browser to the same link twice.

Lastly, it is highly recommended that for each driver B<$object>,
one should call $object->isFinished() prior to making a subsequent
call to $object->drive(), in order to verify that the driver has
not exhausted its set of links to visit.  Otherwise, if
$object->drive() is called with an empty set of links to visit,
the corresponding operation will B<croak>.

=head1 METHODS OVERRIDDEN

The following functions have been overridden by the FF driver.  All other
methods were implemented by the generic Browser driver.  For further
information about the Browser driver, see the L<HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser>
documentation.

=head2 $object->drive(url => $url)

=over 4

Drives an instance of Mozilla Firefox for one iteration,
navigating either to the specified URL or to the next URL computed within
the Browser driver's internal hashtables.

For a description of which hashtable is consulted upon each iteration of
drive(), see the B<next_link_to_visit> description of the 
L<HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::Browser> documentation, in the
"DEFAULT PARAMETER LIST" section.

Once a drive() iternation has completed, the corresponding browser process
is terminated.  Thus, each call to drive() invokes a new instance of the
browser.

I<Inputs>:
 B<$url> is an optional argument, specifying the next immediate URL the browser
must drive to.

I<Output>: The updated FF driver B<$object>, containing state information from driving the
browser for one iteration.

B<Warning>: This method will B<croak>, if the FF driver object is B<unable>
to navigate to a new link, because its list of links to vist is empty and no new
URL was supplied.

=head1 BUGS & ASSUMPTIONS

This package will only run on Win32 platforms.  Furthermore, it has
only been tested to work reliably within a Cygwin environment.

In a nutshell, this object is nothing more than a blessed anonymous
reference to a hashtable, where (key => value) pairs are defined in
the L<DEFAULT PARAMETER LIST>, as well as fed via the new() function
during object initialization.  As such, this package does B<not>
perform any rigorous B<data validation> prior to accepting any new
or overriding (key => value) pairs.

However, additional links can be fed to any FF driver at any time, by
simply adding new hashtable entries to the B<links_to_visit> hashtable
within the B<$object>.

For example, if you wanted to add the URL "http://www.mitre.org"
to the FF driver B<$object>, simply use the following code:

  $object->{links_to_visit}->{'http://www.mitre.org'} = 1;

In general, the FF driver does B<not> know how many links it will
ultimately end up browsing to, until it conducts an exhaustive
spider of all initial URLs supplied.  As such, expect the output
of $object->status() to change significantly, upon each
$object->drive() iteration.

For example, if at one given point, the status of B<percent_complete>
is 30% and then this value drops to 15% upon another iteration, then
this means that the total number of links to drive to has greatly
increased.

Lastly, we assume that the Mozilla Firefox browser has
been preconfigured to B<not cache any data>.  This ensures the browser
will render the most recent version of the content hosted at each URL.
