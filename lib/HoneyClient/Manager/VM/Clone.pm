=head1 NAME

HoneyClient::Manager::VM::Clone - Perl extension to provide a generic object
model for handling a single HoneyClient cloned VM on the host system.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to HoneyClient::Manager::VM::Clone version 0.97.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# XXX: FIX THIS

  # NOTE: This package is an INTERFACE specification only!  It is
  # NOT intended to be used directly.  Rather, it is expected that
  # other Driver specific sub-packages will INHERIT and IMPLEMENT
  # these methods.

  # Eventually, change each reference of 'HoneyClient::Agent::Driver'
  # to an implementation-specific 'HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::*' 
  # package name.
  use HoneyClient::Agent::Driver;

  # Library used exclusively for debugging complex objects.
  use Data::Dumper;

  # Eventually, call the new() function on an implementation-specific
  # Driver package name.
  my $driver = HoneyClient::Agent::Driver->new();

  # If you want to see what type of "state information" is physically
  # inside $driver, try this command at any time.
  print Dumper($driver);

  # Continue to "drive" the driver, until it is finished.
  while (!$driver->isFinished()) {

      # Before we drive the application to a new set of resources,
      # find out where we will be going within the application, first.
      print "About to contact the following resources:\n";
      print Dumper($driver->next());

      # Now, drive the application.
      $driver->drive();

      # Get status of current iteration of work.
      print "Status:\n";
      print Dumper($driver->status());
      
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

# XXX: FIX THIS

This library allows the Agent module to access any drivers running on the
HoneyClient VM in a consistent fashion.  This module is object-oriented in
design, allowing specific types of drivers to inherit these abstractly
defined interface methods.

Fundamentally, a "Driver" is a programmatic construct, designed to
automate a back-end application that is intended to be exploited by
different types of malware.  As such, the "Agent" interacts with each
B<application-specific> Driver running inside the HoneyClient VM, in
order to programmatically automate the corresponding applications.

When a "Driver" is "driven", this implies that the back-end application
is accessing a B<new> Internet resource, in order to intentionally be exposed
to new malware and thus become exploited.

Example implementation Drivers involve automating certain types and
B<versions> of web browsers (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla 
Firefox) or even email applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla
Thunderbird).

=head1 DEFAULT PARAMETER LIST

When a Clone B<$object> is instantiated using the B<new()> function,
the following parameters are supplied default values.  Each value
can be overridden by specifying the new (key => value) pair into the
B<new()> function, as arguments.

Furthermore, as each parameter is initialized, each can be individually 
retrieved and set at any time, using the following syntax:

  my $value = $object->{key}; # Gets key's value.
  $object->{key} = $value;    # Sets key's value.

=head2 bypass_clone

=over 4

When set to 1, the object will forgo any type of initial cloning
operation, upon initialization.  Otherwise, cloning will occur
as normal, upon initialization.

    # When set to 1, the object will forgo any type of initial cloning
    # operation, upon initialization.  Otherwise, cloning will occur

#######################################################################

# Helper function designed to programmatically get or set parameters
# within this object, through indirect use of the AUTOLOAD function.
#
# It's best to explain by example:
# Assume we have defined a driver object, like the following.
#
# use HoneyClient::Manager::VM::Clone;
# my $clone = HoneyClient::Manager::VM::Clone->new(someVar => 'someValue');
#
# What this function allows us to do, is programmatically, get or set
# the 'someVar' parameter, like:
#
# my $value = $clone->someVar();    # Gets the value of 'someVar'.
# my $value = $clone->someVar('2'); # Sets the value of 'someVar' to '2'
#                                   # and returns '2'.
#
# Rather than creating getter/setter functions for every possible parameter,
# the AUTOLOAD function allows us to create these operations in a generic,
# reusable fashion.

=head1 METHODS IMPLEMENTED 

The following functions have been implemented by any Clone object.

=head2 HoneyClient::Manager::VM::Clone->new($param => $value, ...)

=over 4

Creates a new Clone object, which contains a hashtable
containing any of the supplied "param => value" arguments.
Upon creation, the Clone object clones the supplied master VM.

I<Inputs>:
 B<$param> is an optional parameter variable.
 B<$value> is $param's corresponding value.
 
Note: If any $param(s) are supplied, then an equal number of
corresponding $value(s) B<must> also be specified.

I<Output>: The instantiated Clone B<$object>, fully initialized.

=back

=begin testing

# Create a generic clone, with test state data.
my $clone = HoneyClient::Manager::VM::Clone->new(test => 1, bypass_clone => 1);

isa_ok($clone, 'HoneyClient::Manager::VM::Clone', "new(test => 1, bypass_clone => 1)") or diag("The new() call failed.");

# TODO: Need more comprehensive test, where the clone actually gets created.

=end testing

=cut

sub new {
    # - This function takes in an optional hashtable,
    #   that contains various key => 'value' configuration
    #   parameters.
    #
    # - For each parameter given, it overwrites any corresponding
    #   parameters specified within the default hashtable, %PARAMS, 
    #   with custom entries that were given as parameters.
    #
    # - Finally, it returns a blessed instance of the
    #   merged hashtable, as an 'object'.

    # Get the class name.
    my $self = shift;

    # Get the rest of the arguments, as a hashtable.
    # Hash-based arguments are used, since HoneyClient::Util::SOAP is unable to handle
    # hash references directly.  Thus, flat hashtables are used throughout the code
    # for consistency.
    my %args = @_;

    # Check to see if the class name is inherited or defined.
    my $class = ref($self) || $self;

    # Initialize default parameters.
    $self = { };
    my %params = %{dclone(\%PARAMS)};
    @{$self}{keys %params} = values %params;

    # Now, overwrite any default parameters that were redefined
    # in the supplied arguments.
    @{$self}{keys %args} = values %args;

    # Now, assign our object the appropriate namespace.
    bless $self, $class;

    if (!$self->{'bypass_clone'}) {
        $LOG->info("Cloning Master VM.");
        #$self->_baseline();
    }

    # Finally, return the blessed object.
    return $self;
}

=pod

=head2 $object->drive()

=over 4

Drives the back-end application for one iteration, updating the
corresponding internal object state with information obtained
from driving this application for one iteration.

I<Output>: The updated Driver B<$object>, containing state information
from driving the application for one iteration.  Will croak if
operation fails.

#=begin testing

}

=pod

=head2 $object->isFinished()

=over 4

Indicates if the Driver B<$object> has driven the back-end application
through the Driver's entire state and is unable to drive the application
further without additional input.

I<Output>: True if the Driver B<$object> is finished, false otherwise.

=back

#=begin testing
#
# Create a generic driver, with test state data.
#my $driver = HoneyClient::Agent::Driver->new(test => 1);

    # Emit generic "not implemented" error message.
    $LOG->error($class . "->isFinished() is not implemented!");
    Carp::croak "Error: " . $class . "->isFinished() is not implemented!\n";
}

=pod

=head2 $object->next()

=over 4

Returns the next set of server hostnames and/or IP addresses that the
back-end application will contact, upon the next subsequent call to
the B<$object>'s drive() method.

Specifically, the returned data is a reference to a hashtable, containing
detailed information about which resources, hostnames, IPs, protocols, and 
ports that the application will contact upon the next iteration.

Here is an example of such returned data:

  $hashref = {
  
      # The set of servers that the driver will contact upon
      # the next drive() operation.
      targets => {
          # The application will contact 'site.com' using
          # TCP ports 80 and 81.
          'site.com' => {
              'tcp' => [ 80, 81 ],
          },

          # The application will contact '192.168.1.1' using
          # UDP ports 53 and 123.
          '192.168.1.1' => {
              'udp' => [ 53, 123 ],
          },
 
          # Or, more generically:
          'hostname_or_IP' => {
              'protocol_type' => [ portnumbers_as_list ],
          },
      },

      # The set of resources that the driver will operate upon
      # the next drive() operation.
      resources => {
          'http://www.mitre.org/' => 1,
      },
  };

B<Note>: For each hostname or IP address specified, if B<no>
corresponding protocol/port sub-hastables are given, then it
must be B<assumed> that the back-end application may contact
the hostname or IP address using B<ANY> protocol/port.

I<Output>: The aforementioned B<$hashref> containing the next set of
resources that the back-end application will attempt to contact upon
the next drive() iteration.

# XXX: Resolve this.

B<Note>: Eventually this B<$hashref> will become a structured object,
created via a HoneyClient::Util::* package.  However, the underlying
structure of this hashtable is not expected to change. 

=back

#=begin testing
#
# Create a generic driver, with test state data.
#my $driver = HoneyClient::Agent::Driver->new(test => 1);
#dies_ok {$driver->next()} 'next()' or diag("The next() call failed.  Expected next() to throw an exception.");

    # Emit generic "not implemented" error message.
    $LOG->error($class . "->next() is not implemented!");
    Carp::croak "Error: " . $class . "->next() is not implemented!\n";
}

=pod

=head2 $object->status()

=over 4

Returns the current status of the Driver B<$object>, as it's state
exists, between subsequent calls to $object->driver().

Specifically, the data returned is a reference to a hashtable,
containing specific statistical information about the status
of the Driver's progress during back-end application automation.

As such, the exact structure of this returned hashtable is not strictly
defined.  Instead, it is left up to each specific Driver implementation
to return useful, statistical information back to the Agent that
makes sense for the driven application.

For example, if an Internet Explorer specific Driver were implemented,
then the corresponding status hashtable reference returned may look
something like:

  $hashref = {
      'links_remaining'  =>       56, # Number of URLs left to process.
      'links_processed'  =>       44, # Number of URLs processed.
      'links_total'      =>      100, # Total number of URLs given.
      'percent_complete' => '44.00%', # Percent complete.
  };

For another example, if an Outlook specific Driver were implemented,
then the corresponding status hashtable reference returned may look
something like:

  $hashref = {
      'mail_remaining'   =>       56, # Number of messages left to process.
      'mail_processed'   =>       44, # Number of messages processed.
      'mail_total'       =>      100, # Total number of messages given.
      'percent_complete' => '44.00%', # Percent complete.
  };

I<Output>: A corresponding B<$hashref>, containing statistical information
about the Driver's progress, as previously mentioned.

# XXX: Resolve this.

B<Note>: The exact structure of this status hashtable may become more
concrete, as we define a generic concept of a "unit of work" per every
iteration of the $object->drive() method.  For example, it may be
likely that each Driver will attempt to contact a series of resources
per every "unit of work" iteration.  As such, we may generically
record how many "work units" are remaining, processed, and total --
rather than specifically state "links" or "mail" within the hashtable
key names, accordingly.

At the least, it can be assumed that even if a generic structure were
defined, we would leave room available in the status hashtable to
capture additional, implementation-specific statistics that are not
generic among every Driver implementation.

=head1 BUGS & ASSUMPTIONS

This package has been designed in an object-oriented fashion, as a
simple B<INTERFACE> for other, more robust fully-implemented 
HoneyClient::Agent::Driver::* sub-packages to inherit.

Specifically, B<ONLY> the new() function is implemented in this package.
While this allows any user to create Driver B<$object>s by explicitly
calling the HoneyClient::Agent::Driver->new() function, any subsequent
calls to any other method (i.e., $object->drive()) will B<FAIL>, as it is
expected that fully defined Driver sub-packages would implement these
capabilities.

In a nutshell, this object is nothing more than a blessed anonymous
reference to a hashtable, where (key => value) pairs are defined in
the L<DEFAULT PARAMETER LIST>, as well as fed via the new() function
during object initialization.  As such, this package does B<not>
perform any rigorous B<data validation> prior to accepting any new
or overriding (key => value) pairs.
