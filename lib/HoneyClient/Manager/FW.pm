=head1 NAME

HoneyClient::Manager::FW - Perl module to remotely handle firewall rule/chain creation and deletion
which will provide network connectivity for the honeyclients during crawling.  Additionally,
it will provide protection when the honeyclients become compromised by enabling static rate limiting(tcp/udp/icmp)
and MAC address filtering.

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to HoneyClient::Manager::FW version 1.02.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 CREATING THE SOAP SERVER

  # Make sure HoneyClient::Util::Config loads properly
use HoneyClient::Util::Config qw(getVar);

# Make sure IPTables::IPv4 loads
use IPTables::IPv4;

# Make sure HoneyClient::Manager::FW can load
use HoneyClient::Manager::Firewall::FW;

# Make sure HoneyClient::Util::SOAP loads properly
require_ok('HoneyClient::Util::SOAP');

package HoneyClient::Manager::Firewall::FW;
use HoneyClient::Util::SOAP qw(getClientHandle getServerHandle);
my $daemon = getServerHandle();
$daemon->handle;

The SOAP firewall server will  boot up when the honeywall is started by the HoneyClient manager.  The main
directory that holds all the listener code is the /hc directory.  startFWListener.pl is located in the /etc/rc.d/rc3.d directory and
will boot up when the honeywall starts up in run level three.  After start up, the firewall listener will await calls from the HoneyClient
manager so that the firewall may be configured properly and dynamically updated when crawling begins.

Steps to get honeyclient listening:

1.  Boot up honeyclient honeywall vmware image.
2.  Start up our SOAP firewall and SOAP log listener
/usr/bin/perl /hc/startFWListener.pl > /dev/null 2> /dev/null &
These will start upon boot of the honeywall so you will not have to do anything except boot the image.
3.  Now the firewall is listening for all SOAP client calls
4.  Do a "ps -xf" to confirm that your firewall is listening
    It should show something like:
    7580 pts/0    S      0:01 /usr/bin/perl /hc/startFWListener.pl
5.  Make your FW calls now from honeyclient-client.pl.

=head2 INTERACTING WITH SOAP SERVER

 use HoneyClient::Util::SOAP qw(getClientHandle);
 use HoneyClient::Util::Config qw(getVar);

After the honeywall boots up, startFWListerner.pl will be executed and begin listening.  From
here we want to start interacting with our SOAP FW server.

 # Create a new SOAP client, to talk to the HoneyClient::Manager::FW module
 # @initlist will contain all the return values sent back from the server (PID of startFWListerner.pl on server and status message)
 #  Lets set our default honeyclient ruleset:
  my $stub = getClientHandle(namespace => "HoneyClient::Manager::FW");
  my $som = $stub->installDefaultRules();
  my @initlist = $som->paramsall;
  print "$_\n" foreach (@initlist);

 # To dynamically append new rules to the iptables ruleset, do the following
$hashref = this data structure will be passed from the manager to the HoneyClient::Manager::FW

 $som = $stub->addRules( $hashref );
 print $stub->result;
 print "\n";

# To dynamically delete rules, all you need to do is delete the user-defined chain that was originally created.

$som = $stub->deleteChain( $hashref );
print $stub->result;
print "\n";

# To get the status of the current iptables ruleset, this function prints to hard disk the working iptables ruleset
$som = $stub->getStatus();
print $stub->result;
print "\n";

# For all new VM's that we plan to add later on, we will have to add new VM chains:
$som = $stub->addChain( $hashref);
print $stub->result;
print "\n";

 # To shutdown the Firewall SOAP listner on the Honeywall
$som = $stub->FWShutdown();
print $stub->result;
print "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Once created, the daemon acts as a stand-alone SOAP server,
processing individual requests from the  HoneyClient manager
and manipulating the IPTables ruleset on the transparent
virtual honeywall.

=head1 EXTERNAL SOAP FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item *

installDefaultRules()

The installDefaultRules function awaits a call from the Honeyclient manager, once a call is made the function performs numerous subfunctions but
mainly handles creation of the default iptables ruleset for the honeyclient network.
IPTables ruleset:
Since we are using our honeywall to do transparent packet forwarding, forwarded packets will be traversing the
IPTables FORWARD chain, which is associated with the filter table.  By adding rules to the FORWARD chain, you
can control the flow of traffic between our two networks (honeyclient and external network).
Instead of using a single, built-in chain for all protocols, we use a user-defined chain to determine the protocol type,
then hand off the actual final processing to our user-defined chain in the filter table.


I<Inputs>: nothing - No specific input
I<Output>: Success if default ruleset was created, failure if not

addChain();

add_vm_chain adds the user-defined chain based on manager client parameters.

I<Inputs>:
B<$class>is the package name
B<$hashref> - hash reference that will be sent over from HoneyClient::Agent.  It will then be parsed by get_vm_from_hash()
and give me an array of VM names that will be added from the iptables chain list.  The reason we have broken
add_vm_chain() up and made it its separate subroutine is because when we add a rule to the iptables ruleset, we
must first have a user-defined chain in place.  A commit must occur which writes it to the kernel-level netfilter subsystem, then the rule must be added after that has occurred.

I<Output>: returns true if VM chain was deleted, returns false if not

addRules($hashref)

addRules is a function that handles the addition of a new iptable rule into the existing IPTables ruleset which allow honeyclients functionality to crawl
the internet in search of malicious web sites.  addRules first checks for the existance of the user-defined chain before it
creates a new VM rule.  If the chain already exists, the rule can not be added since their is no corresponding chain.
If it does exist, the rule is added successfully.  All addRules calls are logged.

The addRules() function will recieve a $hashref which will be a muli-level hash table whose structure
will resemble the below data structure:

my $hashref = {

    '0d599f0ec05c3bda8c3b8a6' => {    # VM identifier.
        # You'll notice that we add a new layer to the table.
        # This is an MD5SUM that represents the unique identifier
        # of the VM *NAME*.  You can assume that this name will be
        # initially generated and used by HC::Manager::VM.

        # The next 2 keys contain the data from HC::Agent::Driver->next()
        'targets' => {    # This keyname used to be called 'servers'

            # The browser will contact 'www.mitre.org' at
            # TCP port 80.
            'www.mitre.org'   => { 'tcp' => [ 80 ], },
            'rcf.mitre.org'   => { 'tcp' => [ 80 ], },
            'blogs.mitre.org' => { 'tcp' => [ 80 ], },
            'www.cnn.com'     => { 'tcp' => [ 80, 8080 ], },
            'pool.ntp.org'    => { 'udp' => [ 123, ], },

            # General example:
            # The application will contact '192.168.1.1' at
            # some unknown TCP port.
            #
            # If the ports are unknown, the firewall
            # should allow outbound contact to all unprivileged
            # ports (1025-65535) on the specified server. (Yes, I
            # realize in reality, there's an upstream DMZ firewall
            # blocking this functionality; this is simply an
            # architectural design, for now.)
            #'192.168.1.1' => { 'tcp' => "undef", },

            # Or, more generically:
            #'hostname_or_IP' => {
            #    'protocol_type' => [ portnumbers_as_list ],
            #},

        },

        'resources' => {

            # This hashtable contains a list of key, value pairs
            # that reflect the list of resources that the driver
            # will contact next. For browsers, this means URLs.
            # The (1) value is simply a numerical
            # placeholder that serves no purpose, for now.
            'http://www.mitre.org' => 1,
        },

        # Now, we expect HC::Manager to add this next key.
        # This sub-hashtable contains all the source IPs, ports,
        # and protocols that the VM will use to make its outbound
        # connection to remote resources.
        'sources' => {

            '00:04:23:08:7d:54' => { # The VM's MAC address.

                '10.0.0.128' => {    # The VM's internal IP.

                    # In most cases, a VM will only _have_ one
                    # NAT-ted IP.  However, this format allows for the
                    # remote possibility that a VM may have multiple
                    # virtual NICs or multiple IP aliases, in which case
                    # the VM may have multiple source IPs.

                    'tcp' => undef,

                    # We use the same protocol => port syntax as described
                    # before.  Again, if the value is 'undef', then that
                    # indicates that the VM may use any unprivileged port
                    # locally inside its OS, when initiating outbound
                    # communication to the remote resource.

_setDefaultRules()

This function parses the /etc/resolv.conf file and grabs the DNS settings, then creates iptables rules on the INPUT/FORWARD
and OUTPUT chains from thoses DNS settings.  Additionally, we create rules to allow the firewall to talk to itself via the localhost.

Additionally, at the end of the opendefault function are two rules:

"iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT"
"iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT"

These rules track state and  allow traffic to be forwarded in both directions.  It also only allows initiated
10.0.0.0/24 outbound traffic to be sent.  This is necessary since we only want our honeyclients to recieve traffic
that they initiated and no other.  For starters, our honeyclients will just be examining HTTP traffic but might be examining
other protocols in the future.  Either way, all established and initiated connections that match this rule and be allowed out.

_resolveHost() is a helper function that takes in destination domain name and
spits out an array list of resolved ip addresses

I<Inputs>:
Requires domain name ($host)
I<Output>: returns array list of resolved IP addresses
