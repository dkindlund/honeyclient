/*
	Class: Analyzer

	The analyzer is the central part of the client component of Capture. It creates all of the objects necessary for monitoring
	the system and maintaing a connection to the server. It implements most of the Listener interfaces avaiable so that it can
	be notified when a particular event is receieved. All events that are received inside the <OnVisitEvent>, <OnProcessEvent>, and
	<OnRegistryEvent> are malicious as the monitors themselves take care of exclusions. Only one call to each On* function occurs at
	a time however there maybe multiple different On* functions being called at a time. This is protected by the <ServerConnection::Send>
	function which only allows one thread to access it.
