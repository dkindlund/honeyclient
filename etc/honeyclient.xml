HoneyClient Configuration File

This configuration file is used by the HoneyClient perl modules in
order to specify and use the following global configuration options.

For information about the syntax of this file format, please type
"perldoc XML::Simple".

CVS: $Id$

#######################################################################

Syntax Notes:

Note: During processing, if the HoneyClient expects a module-specific
variable to be present within this configuration file (e.g., "address")
but it is not listed or commented out, then the code will attempt
to look for the same variable within any of the module's parents.

For example, the code may expect:
<HoneyClient>
    <Agent>
        <Driver>
            <address>localhost</address>
        </Driver>
    </Agent>
</HoneyClient>

But the following will work as well:
<HoneyClient>
    <Agent>
        <address>localhost</address>
    </Agent>
</HoneyClient>

<HoneyClient>
    <address>localhost</address>
</HoneyClient>

Keep in mind, though, that some variables should remain module-specific
(i.e., "port") in order to avoid collisions between modules.
